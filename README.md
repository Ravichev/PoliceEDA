# Police stops EDA
First practice in EDA with police data. In this notebook i:  
• examined the structure and characteristics of the dataset,  
• detected outliers, missing values, and anomalies,  
• analyzed distributions and relationships between variables,  
• created various plots, charts, and correlation matrices to visualize the data,  
•  formulated hypotheses and validated or rejected them based on the data.
