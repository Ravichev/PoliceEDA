# PoliceEDA
First practice in EDA with police data. In this notebook i:
• examined the structure and characteristics of the dataset,
• detected outliers, missing values, and anomalies,
• analyzed distributions and relationships between variables,
• created various plots, charts, and correlation matrices to visualize the data,
• came up with hypotheses and confirmed/disproved them.
